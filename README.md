# Berkeley Housing Trend Analysis

This repository is part of the Daily Californian's Projects Team initiative to analyze historical trends in the Berkeley housing market. The data is collected using the Wayback Machine, preprocessed, and analyzed to uncover key insights.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Scrape housing listings from archived pages (e.g., Berkeley's Housing Website) using the Wayback Machine.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and format data, handling missing values, date normalization, and location standardization.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze data to uncover trends in rent, availability, property type, and neighborhood.
4. **Trend Analysis**: Identify key housing market trends over time, including rent fluctuations and housing demand shifts.

## Usage
1. Scraping + Preprocess using prelim_scrape.ipynb
